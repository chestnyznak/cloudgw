= VPP Installation and Configuration

VPP used as a data plane engine for Cloudgw.
Before running Cloudgw, you need to install and preconfigure VPP.

== Installation

- Load kernel module:

----
uio_pci_generic
----

 - https://s3-docs.fd.io/vpp/24.06/gettingstarted/installing/ubuntu.html[downloading and Installing VPP for Ubuntu]

NOTE: If you use Mellanox NIC, you need to compile VPP from source with DPDK and Mellanox support enabled (with flags `DPDK_MLX4_PMD`, `DPDK_MLX5_PMD`, `DPDK_MLX5_COMMON_PMD`)

== Configuration

- Create log directory and file (optional):

----
mkdir -p /var/log/vpp/
touch /var/log/vpp/vpp.log
chmod 644 /var/log/vpp/vpp.log
----

- Find PCI address of VPP data plane interface (an interface that will be used for VPP traffic), the PCI address will be used in `/etc/vpp/startup.conf` configuration file.:

[source,shell]
----
sudo lshw -class network -businfo
----

- Edit `/etc/vpp/startup.conf` configuration file:

[source,shell]
----
unix {
  nodaemon
  log /var/log/vpp/vpp.log
  full-coredump
  cli-listen /run/vpp/cli.sock
  cli-no-pager
  gid vpp
}
api-trace {
  on
}
api-segment {
  gid vpp
}
socksvr {
  default
}
cpu {
  main-core 1
  corelist-workers 2-9 # adjust according to your needs
}
dpdk {
  dev default {
    num-rx-queues 8 # adjust according to your needs
    num-tx-queues 8 # adjust according to your needs
  }
  dev 0000:00:07.0 # pci address from previous step
  no-multi-seg
----

- Edit VPP memory config `/etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf`

[source,shell]
----
# Number of 2MB hugepages desired
vm.nr_hugepages=32768 # adjust according to your needs

# Must be greater than or equal to (2 * vm.nr_hugepages).
vm.max_map_count=66560 # adjust according to your needs

# All groups allowed to access hugepages
vm.hugetlb_shm_group=0

# Shared Memory Max must be greater or equal to the total size of hugepages.
# For 2MB pages, TotalHugepageSize = vm.nr_hugepages * 2 * 1024 * 1024
# If the existing kernel.shmmax setting  (cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax)
# is greater than the calculated TotalHugepageSize then set this parameter
# to current shmmax value.
kernel.shmmax=68719476736 # adjust according to your needs
----

- Restart VPP to apply the changes:

----
sudo systemctl restart vpp.service
